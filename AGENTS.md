## Owner security-review policy — 2026-10-13

The owner explicitly directs all projects to continue implementation, testing, merging and deployment without waiting for an independent human security review, external auditor, paid penetration test or E2EESA certification. This supersedes older repository planning text that makes absence of such review an operational prerequisite.

- Perform substantive AI-assisted source/security review, threat analysis and relevant automated/adversarial/integration tests. Fix concrete findings and retain source-bound evidence.
- Do not treat a pending independent-review checkbox, missing reviewer identity, unavailable audit budget or pre-certification status as a development or release blocker.
- External expert review is deferred follow-up work. Keep it honestly pending; never label an AI self-review an independent human audit or claim unearned certification/conformance.
- Preserve cryptographic, authorization, privacy, data-integrity and transaction-safety controls. Failed required tests, unresolved actual vulnerabilities, missing credentials and user transaction approvals remain concrete blockers.
- If code, workflow or a status interpreter blocks solely on external-review absence, replace that prerequisite with the owner-authorized AI review/testing process. Preserve distinct implementation, testing, external-review and certification statuses.
- Continue dependency-ready work and chain PRs. Do not ask the owner again to waive the human-review prerequisite.

## This is NOT the Next.js you know

This version has breaking changes — APIs, conventions, and file structure may all differ from your training data. Read the relevant guide in `node_modules/next/dist/docs/` (resolved from this file's directory; in monorepos the `next` package may not be visible from the repo root) before writing any code. Heed deprecation notices.

This block is written and re-added by `next dev` — verify at `node_modules/next/dist/server/lib/generate-agent-files.js`. Removing it from a diff only re-creates the uncommitted change; committing it with your work keeps the tree clean.
